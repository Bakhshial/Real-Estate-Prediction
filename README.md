# Real-State-Prediction 
I took a deep dive into real estate data to understand what makes properties tick. Here's what I did:

• Analyzed real estate data to understand property values.
• Cleaned and organized messy data.
• Visualized trends in location, price, and other factors.
• Created new data points (e.g., price per sq meter) for better analysis.
• Trained models to predict property prices.

What Makes a Property Expensive? Does it depend on where it is, how big it is, or what kind of place it is?
Who's Buying Where? Can I figure out which areas or property types are most popular?
Can We Guess Prices? Can I build a tool to estimate how much a property might cost based on its features?
This project helped me understand the real estate market better.
