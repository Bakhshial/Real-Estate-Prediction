# Real-State-Prediction 
Digging into Real Estate Data: Prices, Locations & More!
I took a deep dive into real estate data to understand what makes properties tick. Here's what I did:

Cleaning Up the Data: Imagine a messy room – that's kind of like the raw data. I fixed any errors, filled in missing info, and made sure everything was organized.
Exploring the Data: Like looking at a map, I visualized the data to see patterns and how things like location, type of property, and price fit together. This helped me understand the big picture.
Building Clever Features: I created new details from the existing data, like a "price per square meter" to make things easier for the models to understand.
Training the Models: Think of these models like superheroes – they learn from the data and can then predict things, like property prices! I tried a bunch of different models (like fancy math tools) to see which one worked best for this data.
By doing all this, I learned some cool stuff about the real estate market, like:

What Makes a Property Expensive? Does it depend on where it is, how big it is, or what kind of place it is?
Who's Buying Where? Can I figure out which areas or property types are most popular?
Can We Guess Prices? Can I build a tool to estimate how much a property might cost based on its features?
This project helped me understand the real estate market better.  I can share more details about the specific tools I used or how well the price predictions worked if you'd like!
